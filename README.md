BraneAI

In the healthcare industry, preventive measures to save lives are often better than mitigating a present disease in patients' lives. 

This is more apparent when dealing with Cancer.

With BraneAI, hospitals can run MRI scans of patients through the trained model to secure accurate predictions of growing tumors, aiding with better treatment options for patients in hospitals with little access to efficient technology due to low funding.

Project was inspired by Headstarter AI.

Currently under development, will follow up with more updates.
